**📦 Retail Pulse: Superstore Sales Performance Dashboard**

An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze sales performance, profitability trends, and customer behavior across regions, categories, and segments within a superstore retail environment.

The Retail Pulse Dashboard provides a detailed and visually intuitive analysis of superstore sales data. It helps stakeholders explore key performance indicators, identify underperforming areas, and optimize business strategies through data-driven insights.

**Tech Stack**

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Core platform for creating data visualizations and reports.
• 📂 Power Query Editor – Used for cleaning, transforming, and reshaping raw sales data.
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Implemented to compute dynamic KPIs like profit ratio, YoY growth, and running totals.
• 📝 Data Modeling – Relationships set up among orders, customers, products, and regions tables to allow for accurate filtering and aggregation.
• 📁 File Format – .pbit (Power BI Template) for reusable structure and layout.

**Data Source**

Source: Superstore Sample Dataset from GitHub
Structure:
• 9 primary columns: Order ID, Order Date, Customer Name, Region, Category, Sub-Category, Sales, Quantity, Profit
• Temporal coverage: Multiple years of transaction-level data
• Supplementary columns: Ship Mode, Segment, Discount, State, and City for deeper granularity

**Features**

• Business Problem
Retail managers often struggle to get a unified view of performance across different geographies, product categories, and customer segments. With raw data spread across multiple dimensions, it's difficult to answer operational and strategic questions quickly.

• Goal of the Dashboard
1. To create a centralized, interactive visualization tool that:
2. Identifies high- and low-performing regions, segments, and products.
3. Supports decisions around inventory, pricing, marketing, and logistics.
4. Tracks sales and profitability KPIs in real time.
